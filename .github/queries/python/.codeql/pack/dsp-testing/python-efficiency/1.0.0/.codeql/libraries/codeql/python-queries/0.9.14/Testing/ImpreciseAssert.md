# Imprecise assert
The class `unittest.TestCase` provides a range of assertion methods. As well as the general forms `assertTrue()` and `assertFalse()` more specific forms such as `assertGreaterEquals()` and `assertNotIn()` are provided. By using the more specific forms it is possible to get more precise and informative failure messages in the event of a test failing. This can speed up the debugging process.


## Recommendation
Replace all calls to `assertTrue()` and `assertFalse()` that do not provide a custom failure message with a more specific variant. Alternatively, provide a tailored failure message using the `assertTrue(condition, message)` form.


## Example
In this example, `assertTrue()` and `assertFalse()` are used.


```python
from unittest import TestCase

class MyTest(TestCase):
    
    
    def testInts(self):
        self.assertTrue(1 == 1)
        self.assertFalse(1 > 2)
        self.assertTrue(1 in []) #This will fail

```
This will make it more difficult to determine what has gone wrong when `self.assertTrue(1 in [])` fails. The failure message "AssertionError: False is not true" is not very helpful.

A more useful error message can be generated by changing the asserts to the more specific forms as in the following example.


```python
from unittest import TestCase

class MyTest(TestCase):
    
    
    def testInts(self):
        self.assertEqual(1, 1)
        self.assertLessEqual(1, 2)
        self.assertIn(1, []) #This will fail

```
In this case, the failure message "AssertionError: 1 not found in \[\]" is much more informative.
