# First argument to super() is not enclosing class
The `super` class should be called with the enclosing class as its first argument and `self` as its second argument.

Passing a different class may work correctly, provided the class passed is a super class of the enclosing class and the enclosing class does not define an `__init__` method. However, this may result in incorrect object initialization if the enclosing class is later subclassed using multiple inheritance.


## Recommendation
Ensure that the first argument to `super()` is the enclosing class.


## Example
In this example the call to `super(Vehicle, self)` in `Car.__init__` is incorrect as it passes `Vehicle` rather than `Car` as the first argument to `super`. As a result, `super(SportsCar, self).__init__()` in the `SportsCar.__init__` method will not call all `__init__()` methods because the call to `super(Vehicle, self).__init__()` skips `StatusSymbol.__init__()`.


```python


class Vehicle(object):
    pass
        
class Car(Vehicle):
    
    def __init__(self):
        #This is OK provided that Car is not subclassed.
        super(Vehicle, self).__init__()
        self.car_init()
        
class StatusSymbol(object):
    
    def __init__(self):
        super(StatusSymbol, self).__init__()
        self.show_off()
        
class SportsCar(Car, StatusSymbol):
    
    def __init__(self):
        #This will not call StatusSymbol.__init__()
        super(SportsCar, self).__init__()
        self.sports_car_init()

        
#Fix Car by passing Car to super().
#SportsCar does not need to be changed.
class Car(Car, Vehicle):
    
    def __init__(self):
        super(Car, self).__init__()
        self.car_init()
        

```
