# Reflected server-side cross-site scripting
Directly writing user input (for example, an HTTP request parameter) to a webpage without properly sanitizing the input first, allows for a cross-site scripting vulnerability.


## Recommendation
To guard against cross-site scripting, consider escaping the input before writing user input to the page. The standard library provides escaping functions: `html.escape()` for Python 3.2 upwards or `cgi.escape()` older versions of Python. Most frameworks also provide their own escaping functions, for example `flask.escape()`.


## Example
The following example is a minimal flask app which shows a safe and unsafe way to render the given name back to the page. The first view is unsafe as `first_name` is not escaped, leaving the page vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks. The second view is safe as `first_name` is escaped, so it is not vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks.


```python
from flask import Flask, request, make_response, escape

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/unsafe')
def unsafe():
    first_name = request.args.get('name', '')
    return make_response("Your name is " + first_name)

@app.route('/safe')
def safe():
    first_name = request.args.get('name', '')
    return make_response("Your name is " + escape(first_name))

```
