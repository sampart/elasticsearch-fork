# Accepting unknown SSH host keys when using Paramiko
In the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol, host keys are used to verify the identity of remote hosts. Accepting unknown host keys may leave the connection open to man-in-the-middle attacks.


## Recommendation
Do not accept unknown host keys. In particular, do not set the default missing host key policy for the Paramiko library to either `AutoAddPolicy` or `WarningPolicy`. Both of these policies continue even when the host key is unknown. The default setting of `RejectPolicy` is secure because it throws an exception when it encounters an unknown host key.


## Example
The following example shows two ways of opening an SSH connection to `example.com`. The first function sets the missing host key policy to `AutoAddPolicy`. If the host key verification fails, the client will continue to interact with the server, even though the connection may be compromised. The second function sets the host key policy to `RejectPolicy`, and will throw an exception if the host key verification fails.


```python
from paramiko.client import SSHClient, AutoAddPolicy, RejectPolicy

def unsafe_connect():
    client = SSHClient()
    client.set_missing_host_key_policy(AutoAddPolicy)
    client.connect("example.com")

    # ... interaction with server

    client.close()

def safe_connect():
    client = SSHClient()
    client.set_missing_host_key_policy(RejectPolicy)
    client.connect("example.com")

    # ... interaction with server

    client.close()

```
