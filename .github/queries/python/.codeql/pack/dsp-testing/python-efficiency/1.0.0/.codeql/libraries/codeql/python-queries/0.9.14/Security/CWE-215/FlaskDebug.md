# Flask app is run in debug mode
Running a Flask application with debug mode enabled may allow an attacker to gain access through the Werkzeug debugger.


## Recommendation
Ensure that Flask applications that are run in a production environment have debugging disabled.


## Example
Running the following code starts a Flask webserver that has debugging enabled. By visiting `/crash`, it is possible to gain access to the debugger, and run arbitrary code through the interactive debugger.


```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/crash')
def main():
    raise Exception()

app.run(debug=True)

```
