# Clear-text storage of sensitive information
Sensitive information that is stored unencrypted is accessible to an attacker who gains access to the storage. This is particularly important for cookies, which are stored on the machine of the end-user.


## Recommendation
Ensure that sensitive information is always encrypted before being stored. If possible, avoid placing sensitive information in cookies altogether. Instead, prefer storing, in the cookie, a key that can be used to look up the sensitive information.

In general, decrypt sensitive information only at the point where it is necessary for it to be used in cleartext.

Be aware that external processes often store the `standard out` and `standard error` streams of the application, causing logged sensitive information to be stored as well.


## Example
The following example code stores user credentials (in this case, their password) in a cookie in plain text:


```python
from flask import Flask, make_response, request

app = Flask("Leak password")

@app.route('/')
def index():
    password = request.args.get("password")
    resp = make_response(render_template(...))
    resp.set_cookie("password", password)
    return resp

```
Instead, the credentials should be encrypted, for instance by using the `cryptography` module, or not stored at all.
